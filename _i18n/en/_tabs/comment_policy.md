Welcome to Daniel Padua Blog, the place where I return to the internet, some of the knowledge I acquired from the internet. I try my best to make sure that the discussions on my articles are the troll, spam and abuse free but I'm not omnipresent. The comment section can be a great place for interaction with readers, writers and even for spawning stimulating conversation – it can be a great place for all of us! To ensure that you have a good time over here, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:

- Be polite – don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. If something you would say would get you bottled on the head offline, please don’t say it here. Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people.

- Don’t troll. I appreciate and welcome criticism towards me, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting would be deleted without exception.

- Spam? Goodbye. We understand that you may make thousands of dollars working from home, however, we are not interested. Please refrain from posting or I’ll give you a hand and show both you and your post the door.


To put it in a simple sentence, my guidelines boil down to “Don’t be a dick”. If you don’t follow any of these guidelines, I will not only remove the comment but may also ban you from participating in the discussions.

If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – I highly appreciate your support!

Happy commenting!
